# **About this project**

I want to solve Leet Code questions to train myself in writing better algorithm in C++. This is also a chance for me to explore more in-depth of what features are included in C++.

Currently, I am using gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) default version to compile these code so, there will be lack of features that are only offered in C++20 and C++23. I will have to try my best to solve Leet Code problems.
